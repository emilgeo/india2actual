 * Columns chosen to match what Actual's import dialog can actually map:
 * date, payee, notes and amount.
 *
 * Note the deliberate compromise on notes. Actual's CSV field mapping has no
 * `imported_payee` slot (only date, amount, payee, notes, category, in/out and
 * inflow/outflow), so the raw narration goes into Notes to keep it visible.
 * The API path does not have this limitation and sets `imported_payee`
 * properly: this is the one place the CSV route is lossier.
 *
 * `Reference` is emitted for human inspection; leave it unmapped on import.
 *
 * This header is also the signature the round-trip path matches on, so that
 * the tool can read its own output back and push a CSV you have reviewed.
 * Renaming or reordering a column here means updating
 * `interpret/roundtrip.ts`; a test asserts the two agree.
